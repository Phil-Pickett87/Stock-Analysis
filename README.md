# Stock-Analysis
## Overview: 
  The purpose of this project is to refactor the initial code in order to make it run more efficiently. Through refactoring, we can improve our code, make it run smoothly, and clean it up so that it's more legible for anyone that may need to use it.

## Results: 
When running the refactored code, I did notice a slight improvement on the return time. As you can see from the attached images below, the return time was very quick for both 2017 and 2018. These times were a little less than 1 second faster than when being ran on the original code. While overall not a huge difference, running on the refactored code did present a noticeable improvement in the run time.

## Summary: 
  With regards to this project, refactoring the code did improve the functionality of script. While in this case there was not a huge improvement, it’s always better to optimize the code if possible. That is one of the major advantages of refactoring. Even though you aren’t changing the result, optimizing the code can help with its functionality, legibility, and efficiency! Refactoring can also be a helpful way to discover and remove any bugs in a code that might be slowing it down or creating errors. 

  A disadvantage in refactoring is the potential to actually mess up the original code or make it run less efficiently. For this reason, it is always a good idea to make a copy of the original code just in case the updates don't work out. Refactoring can also be a time consuming and in certain cases can hours spent changing code can present little to no improvement, making it ultimately unnecessary. Still the benefits outweigh the cons as in almost every case, there are improvements that can be made!
