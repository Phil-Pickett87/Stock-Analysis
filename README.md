# Stock-Analysis
## Overview: The purpose of this project is to refactor the initial code in order to make it run more efficeintly. Through refactoring, we can improve our code, make it run smoothly, and/or clean it up so that it's more legible for anyone that may need to use it.

## Results: When running the refactored code, I did notice a slight improvement on the return time. As you can see from the attatched images below, the return time was very quick for both 2017 and 2018.
